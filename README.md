ZiZou Project
-------------


This project is an answer to the ZiZou problem, a.k.a. the FizzBuzz problem.
Its aim is to display a string list of numbers from 1 to 100, only replacing
the values by "Zi" when they are multiple of 3, and by "Zou" when they are
multiple of 5.


Usage:

run ./setup.sh

go to localhost:8000
